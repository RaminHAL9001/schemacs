### **NOTE:** This is not a fork of [Guenchi's Schemacs](https://github.com/guenchi/Schemacs)

Since @Guenchi has apparently not had time recently to continue development of her "Schemacs" project, we asked permission of her to name this project "Schemacs" as well, and she very kindly agreed to allow us to use the name Schemacs, as was discussed in [issue 10 of guenchi/Schemacs](https://github.com/guenchi/Schemacs/issues/10).
