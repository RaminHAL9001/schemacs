# Code taken from "Chibi", by Alex Shinn

This subdirectory contains code written by Alex Shinn for the "Chibi"
Scheme implementation which provides features for the Schemacs
software on other Scheme implementations. When running Schemacs on the
Chibi interpreter, none of the code in this directory is used, the
code provided by the Chibi installation is used instead.

Unlike the rest of the Schemacs project, the copyright for all of the
source code in this directory belongs to Alex Shinn, and is released

## Libraries

### `(chibi match)`

This provides Alex Shinn's portable pattern matcher which is used in
the Schemacs Emacs Lisp interpreter.

## Source code

The source code has been slightly modified to work in the Schemacs
code base, but is otherwise exactly the same code as provided in the
Chibi Scheme code repository. This code was copied from:
