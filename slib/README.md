## "SLIB" Libraries

These libraries were originally written by Aubrey Jaffer, and then
modified by Peter Lane in 2017 to remove the SLIB module system system
and instead use the R7RS "define-library" moduel system instead, then
published on the [Snow-Fort website](https://snow-fort.org). All of
these libraries were downloaded from the "Snow Fort" package
repository. Further modifications to this source code have been made
by Ramin Honary to adapt it for use in the Schemacs project.
